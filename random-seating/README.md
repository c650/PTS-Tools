# Random Seating

Program to rearrange students in a classroom so that no two students sit together again. Currently, this program supports one-dimensional seating arrangements (i.e., one row or a circle).

This program was originally written in python, but ports are available.*

\* The exact process for reassigning seats is slightly different in the C++ and Ruby versions, as they were authored by a different person.
