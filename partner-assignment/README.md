# Partner Assignment

This folder contains source code for the generation of partner groups.

---
# Installation

Compile easily with `make`. You will need to have `g++-5` installed.

---
# Usage

The program will specify the arguments it needs. The program will print out
All sets of partners of a given group for a given size.

Note: At this point, the input file must have no two equal entries. This will be resolved soon.
